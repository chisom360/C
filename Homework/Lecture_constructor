Types of constructor:

a) Default contructor:
	-Given to the the class by default ( Default default constructor)
	- Does no initialization
 	ai) Written by the programmer but accepts no parameters

b) Initializing:
	-Constructor requires parameters
c) Copy:
-Builds an object intialized by another object of the class.
-Get one by default if you don't write one.
Makes an exact copy


What is a copy constructor?
A copy constructor is a member function which initializes an object using another object of the same class. A copy constructor has the following general function prototype:
ClassName (const ClassName &old_obj);
